# Progetto API-2019-2020

For the course Algoritmi e Prinicipi dell'Informatica, as a final project it was proposed to develop a text editor, anolougus to the well-known 'ed' text editor. In fact, the goal was to create an efficient text editor in terms of both, data structures and performances, thus algorithms, that could be used by a user from command line. It should offer methods to add and remove lines, print the current text or a portion of it and even undo (or redo) some operations.

The project was developed years ago, when I was just a rookie as a programmer therefore there might be several errors or bugs I just missed. Especially if considering best practice, therefore any advice is all well-accepted. Maybe in the future I will complete the translation into full English, as well as a better docstring and comments for my code which sometimes might be obscure.
